\title{Get Time Series Model}
\usage{
get_model.time_series(x, lag = NULL, labels = NULL, family = gaussian,
  train = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an univariate time series}

\item{lag}{the number of lags to incorporate in the model}

\item{labels}{the dates of the series}

\item{family}{type of family used as input for the glm}

\item{train}{the observations to be used as train input}
}
\description{
An algorithm to find the appropriate time series model. The algorithm performs a forward search on the formula.
As a starting point, a completely empty formula is chosen and every time a sum or product is added/removed. The local optimum is
found by minimizing the Bayesian information criterion-value (BIC-value).

Some improvements still need to be made:
\itemize{
\item Adjust for heterskedasticity
\item Implement smoothing (now only sums and products of constants, linear relations and lags are incorporated)
\item Check for overfitting
}
}
\examples{
data('EIA')
train <- 1:(nrow(data) - 5)
labels <- data$Date
x <- data$Value

model <- get_model(x = x,method = 'time_series', lag = 2, labels = labels, family = gaussian('log'), train = train )
